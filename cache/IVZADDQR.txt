Editor: Pingqing Fu The next-generation geostationary meteorological Himawari-8 satellite carrying the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) allows frequent observations of the atmosphere, the surface, and oceans every 10 min. With its retrieval algorithms recently updated, Himawari-8/AHI Version 2 Level 2 aerosol products are now available. However, these retrievals have not yet undergone a quality assessment. This study aims to comprehensively validate the of fi cial aerosol optical properties derived from Himawari-8/AHI over land and ocean. Aerosol Robotic Network and Sun-Sky Radiometer Observation Network ground-based measurements at 98 stations in the Himawari-domain region are used to validate aerosolopticaldepth (AOD, or τ ) retrievals at500 nmand Ångström exponent (AE) retrievals at 440 – 675 nm from the year 2016. The AOD retrievals agree well with surface observations (i.e., from linear regression, slope = 0.876, intercept = 0.076, and correlation coef fi cient = 0.756) with a mean absolute error and a root-mean-square error of 0.168 and 0.293, respectively. On site and regional scales, large uncertainties are seen, especially in Australia (signi fi cant overestimation) and South Asia (signi fi cant un-derestimation). The AOD retrievals can correctly capture daily variations and show the best (worst) performance in summer (spring). The AE performance is poorer on all scales, showing overall underestimations, especially in Australia, Southeast Asia, and China. The data quality of AOD retrievals improves as the vegetation coverage and

the AE increases. This suggests that the of fi cial aerosol retrieval algorithm still faces great challenges over bright surfaces and under coarse-particle-dominated conditions. In general, approximately 61% and 64% of the AOD matchups meet the newly de fi ned expected errors of [0.330 × τ +0.024; − 0.132 × τ − 0.125] and [0.519 × τ + 0.005; − 0.007 × τ − 0.194] determined by ground measurements and aerosol retrievals, respectively. The highly variable accuracy of aerosol retrievals raises a concern about the reliability of the current product under different environmental conditions and underlying surfaces. It also sheds light on what future improvements need implementing to the aerosol retrieval algorithm.

Aerosols affect weather and the climate system through their direct and indirect radiative forcings ( Charlson et al., 1992 ; Feng et al., 2018 ; Haywood and Boucher, 2000 ; Pöschl, 2005 ; Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2017 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). Closely associated with air pollu-tion, aerosols also have serious adverse effects on human health, espe-cially fi ne particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 2.5 (PM 2.5 ) and 1 (PM 1 ) microns ( Gupta et al., 2006 ; Sun et al., 2016a, 2016b ; Viana et al., 2014 ). PM 2.5 and PM 1 can do much damage to human health ( Bartell et al., 2013 ; Crouse et al., 2012 ; Peng et al., 2009 ; Pöschl, 2005 ). Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Ångström ex-ponent (AE) are two fundamental aerosol optical properties used to quantify the columnar amount and size of aerosol particles. Based on at-mospheric physics theories, these parameters can be extracted from re-motely sensed images over wide spatial scales and long timescales (Kaufman et al., 1997 ). With the development of satellite remote sens-ingtechniques, their spatial,spectral, and temporal resolutionshave im-proved continuously.

Himawari-8, successfully launched on 7 October 2014 by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), is the next-generation geostationary me-teorological satellite carrying the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI). Himawari-8/AHI data are used in meteorological applications and be-came freely available to the public on 7 July 2015. It has similar spectral and spatial characteristics as those of the Advanced Baseline Imager planned for the U.S. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R series of satellites. It acquires data at 16 independent spec-tral channels from visible to infrared wavelengths covering the main Asia-Paci fi cregion(80°E – 160°W, 60°S – 60°N, Fig. 1 ). Images are re-corded every 10 min at a spatial resolution of 0.5 – 1 km in the visible channels and 1 – 2 km in the infrared channels ( Table 1 ). Himawari-8/ AHI has produced various operational products, including atmospheric motion vectors, clear-sky radiative fl uxes, and high-resolution cloud analysis information. The high spatial resolution and frequent imaging time allow more accurate and detailed observations of atmospheric, surface, and ocean targets.

Like instruments on other Sun-synchronous satellites, e.g., the Ad-vanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ( Che et al., 2018 ), the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS, Levy et al., 2013 ; Wei et al., 2019a, 2019b, 2019c ), and the Visible Infrared Imaging

Radiometer Suite ( Jackson et al., 2013 ), Himawari-8/AHI also provides aerosol products at a spatial resolution of 5 km with four temporal res-olutions: 10 min (Level 2), 1 h (Level 3), 1 day (Level 3), and 1 month (Level 3). Multi-source satellite-derived aerosol products have been widely used to estimate near-surface particulate matter concentrations and monitor air quality ( Chen et al., 2018 ; Lv et al., 2017 ; Ma et al., 2014 ; Yao et al., 2018 ; Wei et al., 2019d ). Wang et al. (2017) developed an im-proved linear mixed-effect model to monitor surface hourly PM 2.5 con-centrations from Himawari-8/AHI AOD products over the Beijing – Tianjin – Hebei (BTH) region in China. Zang et al. (2018) estimated hourly PM 1 concentrations from Himawari-8/AHI AOD products matched with coincident ground-based PM 1 measurements using a principal component analysis-general regression neural network method they developed for application in China.

These studies have presented preliminary and limited evaluations of the of fi cial aerosol products. The reliability of the aerosol products is closely related to its applications in these atmospheric pollution studies. With continuous improvements made to the aerosol algorithm,the data version was updated from Version 1 to Version 2 on 10 August 2018. The of fi cial Himawari-8 aerosol products, however, have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. This study thus aims to provide a thorough evaluation of the full-scene Himawari-8 aerosol products over land and ocean.

For this purpose, thelatest Version 2 Level2 10-min aerosol datasets, including AOD retrievals at 500 nm and the AE at 440 – 675 nm, at a spa-tial resolution of 5 km from 2016 are collected and validated against the newest releases of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Chinese Sun – Sky Radiometer Observation Network (SONET) ground-based aerosol optical property measurements. The systematic validation of
