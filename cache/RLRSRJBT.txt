Chen a, b , Tang-Huang Lin a, b , Tsung-Hua Kuo a, b a b Institute of Space Science, National Central University, Chung-Li 320, Taiwan, ROC Abstract The improvement in the structure function method for retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD) with SPOT HRV data and its application in air quality monitoring are highlighted in this paper. Generally speaking, estimation of the aerosol optical depth will be affected by the temporal change of surface canopy, observation geometry and terrain effect when applying the contrast reduction method to the multi-temporal satellite image set. In order to reduce the errors induced by such effects, the single-directional structure function is replaced by the multi-directional mode, which can describe the real characteristics of the surface structure more com-pletely. Comparison of the results with in-site observations show a significant improvement in the accuracy of the retrieved AOD. Furthermore, due to the linear relationship between aerosol optical depth and turbidity coefficient, satellite images can be employed for monitoring air quality. Application of the method is demonstrated with a case study situated around the northern Taiwan area.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction The air pollution discharged by industrial activities has seriously influenced the global environment and human health (Pope et al., 1995), prompting many researchers to derive new methods for monitoring air quality. In past decades, innovations in satellite remote sensing techniques have provided the capability for sur-veying air quality in an economical and rapid way, either for local or global coverage. Undoubtedly, satellite remote sensing can play an important role in monitoring environmental crisis, such as the degeneration caused by air pollution (Kaufman et al., 1990; Sifakis and Deschamps, 1992; Sifakis et al., 1998). Physically speaking, atmospheric turbidity holds a proportional relationship with atmospheric aerosol con-tent, rendering it an important indicator of air quality. The A ̊ ngstro ̈ m turbidity formula clearly states that the atmospheric turbidity can be obtained from the aerosol optical depth (AOD) if the particle size distribution of * Corresponding author.

PII: S 1364-8152(01)00047-0 the aerosol is known. Therefore, ground-based measure-ments of the regional particle size distribution can be employed to derive a representative map of the air qual-ity distribution. We have utilized satellite data to make improvements to the structure function algorithm, hop-ing to gain higher accuracy. Experimental results will be presented in this study. Because the distributions, types, shapes and sizes of aerosols are not uniform and depend strongly on the local area, they cannot be described so easily with a physical model as can atmospheric molecules. As a result, various approaches have been proposed to esti-mate aerosol effects via satellite observation in the past two decades. For example, Ahern et al. (1977) and Griggs (1975) chose clear waterbodies as a reference to estimate the path radiance, and assess the surface reflec-tance through the aid of a radiative transfer model. Through such methods, the surface reflectance of clear waterbodies is assumed to be zero. However, errors may appear since this is not possible in an actual environ-ment. Therefore, Liu et al. (1996) used the Dark Dense Vegetation (DDV) pixels of SPOT (Systeme Pour l’ob-servation de la Terre) HRV (High-Resolution Visible) XS1 (500–590 nm) and XS2 (610–680 nm) data in which the reflectance was already known to serve as a reference for assessing the path radiance. Still, such methods may also fail if there are very few DDV pixels (Liu et al., 1997). Moreover, in the DDV method, it is assumed that the distribution of aerosols is uniform, but this condition would not be consistent with many actual cases (Holben et al., 1991). Because of these drawbacks, methods that do not require estimation of the path radiance were developed. For example, the structure function method proposed by Tanre et al. (1988) has been con fi rmed to show good capability in retrieving AOD distribution from either high-resolution Landsat TM images (Tanre et al., 1988) or low-resolution NOAA AVHRR images (Holben et al., 1992). However, this study attempts to make improve-ments in the procedure of deriving the AOD map with SPOT HRV data. An image covering Chung-Li City along with two neighboring industrial parks located in northern Taiwan was selected as our test case. In order to reduce the assessing error induced by the changes of satellite observation geometry, the surface canopy and the terrain effect, a multi-directional structure function, along with an optimal position number, was proposed in this study. Meanwhile, a set of sunphotometer obser-vations were used to retrieve the AOD distribution from satellite data for application in air quality monitoring. 2. Methodology 2.1. Theoretical overview When an electromagnetic wave in the visible region propagates in the atmosphere, the extinction effects of atmospheric molecules and aerosols are the main radiat-ive interactions the wave encounters. Thus, the AOD can be derived from remote sensing data in the visible bands. For example, Tanre et al. (1988) de fi ned and used a structure function to retrieve the AOD with multi-tem-poral TM images. Their study assumed that the surface was Lambertian, and the apparent re fl ectance, r ∗ , observed by the satellite could be written as (Tanre et al., 1988) r ∗ ( m s , m v , f )  r a ( m s , m v , f ) (1)  T ( m s )[ r exp( − t / m v )+  r  t d ( m v )] 1 −  r  s , where m s = cos q s and q s is the solar zenith angle, m v = cos q v and q v is the satellite zenith angle, r a is the atmospheric re fl ectance, f is the solar azimuth angle related to the satellite, t is the optical depth of the atmos-phere, r is the surface re fl ectance, T is the total transmit-tance on the sun – ground path, s is the atmospheric albedo,  r  is the mean surface re fl ectance, and t d is the diffuse transmission function on the ground – satellite path. The method of approach in this study is based upon the assumption of a Lambertian surface. This assumption means that the surface re fl ective property will not vary with different observation geometry or terrain effects. However, in real cases, the landcover is not Lambertian. Errors induced by this simpli fi ed assumption do exist. However, studies conducted by other research teams (Deschamps et al., 1981; Tanre et al., 1988; Holben et al., 1992), and us as well, reveal that this simpli fi cation can serve as a proper base for non-extreme cases. We make the following assumptions. 1. The multiple re fl ective interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are small and thus can be ignored (Tanre et al., 1981); that is, the  r  s term equals zero. 2. All of the  r  values are the same in a small local area, which means the environmental contribution of the surroundings is equivalent (Tanre et al., 1988; Holben et al., 1992). Consequently, the apparent re fl ectance difference,  r ∗ ( i , j ) ( d ), of two adjacent pixels, ( i , j ) and ( i , j + d ), with distance d can be derived from Eq. (1):  r ∗ ( i , j ) ( d )  r ∗ ( i , j )  r ∗ ( i , j + d )  r ( i , j ) T ( m s ) exp(  t / m v ), (2) where i and j are the row and column indices of the image domain, respectively. If the surface property does not change in the observation period [i.e.,  r ( i , j ) ( d )is constant], the difference of the apparent re fl ectance may be a function of the optical depth. Tanre et al. (1988) further de fi ned a structure function M , with its squared value as M 2 ( d )  1 n i j [ r ( i , j )  r ( i , j + d ) ] 2 , (3) where N is the total number of pixels of the selected area. By substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (2), we obtain M ∗ 2 ( d )  M 2 ( d ) T 2 ( m s ) exp(  2 t / m v ), (4) where M ∗ and M indicate the structure function esti-mated from the satellite observation data and the real surface structure function, respectively. If the surface re fl ectance does not change from time t 1 to t 2 , then M 2 ( d , t 1 ) = M 2 ( d , t 2 ). As a result, the following can be obtained from Eq. (4) with two satellite observations ( t 1 and t 2 ): M ∗ 2 ( d , t 1 ) M ∗ 2 ( d , t 2 )  T 2 ( t 1 ) exp[ − 2 t ( t 1 )/ m v1 ] T 2 ( t 2 ) exp[ − 2 t ( t 2 )/ m v2 ] . (5) Empirically, the log[ T ( m s ) exp(  t / m v )] value has a linear relationship with the AOD ( t a ) (Tanre et al., 1988). Hence, if the AOD value is known at a certain time (e.g., t 1 ), the AOD value at another time ( t 2 ) can be determined and vice versa. With the accurate AOD obtained, the satellite data can be used to assess the atmospheric turbidity for monitor-ing the air quality by employing the A ̊ ngstro ̈ m turbidity formula and the particle size distribution data of the regional aerosols. In the formula, the aerosol extinction can be modeled empirically through (A ̊ ngstro ̈ m, 1929) t a l  bl − a , (6) where t a is the AOD, l is the wavelength, and b is the A ̊ ngstro ̈ m turbidity coef fi cient, which has a positive cor-relation to the atmospheric turbidity. Higher turbidity values indicate a higher aerosol concentration. The values are between 0 and 0.5 in general atmospheric con-ditions. a serves as an indicator of the aerosol ’ s size distribution. A lower a value indicates a larger ratio of coarse particles existing in the atmosphere, and a higher a value indicates a dominance of smaller particles. Gen-erally, the a values range between 0 and 4 (for dust par-ticles, a may be less than 0). Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering can be seen as special cases when a approximately equals 4 and 0, respectively. Based upon the previous equation, it is clear that b can be determined when AOD and a are known. 2.2. Improvements The approach of this study begins with the assumption of a Lambertian surface, so that the surface re fl ective property will not be affected by the observation geometry or terrain effect. In reality, most landcover is not Lambertian, which implies that the results of the retrieved AOD would be in fl uenced by the surface can-opy, observation geometry or terrain effects. The struc-ture function de fi ned in Eq. (3) considers only a single direction, and it cannot model the surface structure very well either. This study strives to overcome this modeling error by extending it to a multi-directional mode as fol-lows: M 2 ( d )  1 3 N i j [( r ( i , j )  r ( i , j + d ) ) 2  ( r ( i , j )  r ( i + d , j ) ) 2 (7)  ( r ( i , j )  r ( i + d , j + d ) ) 2 ], where an additional term, ( r ( i , j )  r ( i + d , j ) ) 2 +( r ( i , j )  r ( i + d , j + d ) ) 2 , is added into the contribution of the structure function in the diagonal direction (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. The directions of i (row), j (column) and c (diagonal direction) de fi ned in the multi-directional structure function. It is obvious that different AOD values will be obtained when different distances ( d ) are given. When the structure functions in the selected area have a higher correlation, the mean of the structure functions (calculated from d = 1to d = 10) is generally used to com-pute the AOD (Holben et al., 1992). On the contrary, when the correlation is very low, even when using the multi-directional mode, the retrieved AOD errors would be considerable. Such low correlation can be caused by different observation geometry, landcover change and the terrain effect. Generally, phenomena like the above can be found quite frequently in real cases. As a result, an “ optimal position number ” can be adopted to solve this problem. 3. Application results As stated above, we made the assumption of a Lam-bertian surface and that the surface properties remain unchanged. Technically, the errors induced from the inconsistency between the assumption and real cases can be more ef fi ciently reduced by the mean re fl ectance of multiple-directions algorithm. A set of six SPOT HRV images acquired during April to August of 1998 was analyzed in this study (see also Table 1). A 30 by 30 pixel image covering the National Central University was fi rst taken (NCU, 24.9 ° N 121.1 ° E) for veri fi cation of the data from the sunphotometer installed on the roof of the University ’ s Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research (CSRSR). The sunphotometer, manufactured by CIMEL Inc. of France, provides fi ve fi lters with center wavelengths of 440, 670, 870, 940 and 1020 nm, respectively. As shown in Table 2, the sunphotometer observations recorded the highest AOD value on May 11, and the lowest on August 21. In this study, we used the data collected on August 21 as our reference in cal-culating the AOD values for the other dates. Obviously, any optical observation data used in this study (or such methods) should be discarded if there is contamination by clouds. Therefore, a rigid threshold should be adopted for the cloud-screening process. In this study, the cloud screening for the SPOT image pixels was done by man-ual interpretation. For sunphotometer data, the tasks of retrieving AOD were processed by AERONET (Holben et al., 1998). However, both schemes would fail for cir-rus cloud cases. Hence, the best method to ensure the retrieved accuracy is to discard all probable cloud-con-taminated data. The LOWTRAN-7 (Kneizys et al., 1988) package was utilized to compute the atmospheric trans-mittance and other radiance parameters from radiosound-observed atmospheric pro fi les. In the general case, the values of the structure function would continue to increase and maintain a similar distri-bution pattern when the distance, d , increases (Tanre et al., 1988; Holben et al., 1992).

Most of the images showed a consistency with the previous descrip-tion, except on July 30 and August 21. Parts of the struc-ture function decreased while the distance d increased, which was especially apparent for the image acquired on August 21 (see also Fig. 2(a)). To reduce such inconsist-ency, which would cause errors in AOD retrieval, the multi-directional structure function was applied. The result revealed better consistency when compared with the single-direction mode, especially on the data of August 21 (Fig. 2(b)). The retrieved AODs at SPOT HRV XS1 band by the single- and multiple-direction structure functions are listed in Table 3. By comparing them with the observations from the sunphotometer, the result showed that the multi-direction mode indeed made a signi fi cant improvement in the AOD accuracy com-pared with the single-direction mode. Excluding the case of May 11, which had a larger error caused by partial cloud shadow appearing in its image area, the maximum error and mean error of these fi ve images were reduced from 33% and 19% to 9% and 6%, respectively. The superiority of the multi-direction algorithm can be clearly seen now. Thus, when applying the algorithm to the entire SPOT HRV XS1 image, a wide-coverage AOD map can be obtained conveniently. Fig. 3(a) is a study case in which the image was acquired on June 27, 1998. The land use in this image included a city (population  330,000), two industrial parks, several towns, farmland and ponds.

The map delineated a reasonable pattern of the in fl uence of human activity in fl uence on air quality. In addition, the study also sought to calculate the par-ticle size distribution parameter ( a ) of the aerosols through the aid of the sunphotometer installed at the National Central University. Since the aerosol constitu-ents are easily in fl uenced by the change of weather pat-terns and atmospheric circulation, they possess strong regional characteristics. In other words, the a value is Table 3 The comparison between the AODs retrieved with SPOT HRV/XS1 data by the structure functions of the single- and multi-directional mode, respectively (*, reference date) Sunphotometer measurements (500 – 590 Single-directional Multi-directional Date nm) Retrieved Error (%) Retrieved Error (%) 04/24/1998 0.339 0.386 14 0.348 3 05/11/1998 0.647 0.394 39 0.374 43 06/27/1998 0.299 0.347 16 0.311 4 07/02/1998 0.209 0.277 33 0.228 9 07/30/1998 0.315 0.356 13 0.345 9 08/21/1998* 0.078 ––– – Fig. 3.

It is clear that the AOD values around the Chung-Li City and the Industrial Park are higher than in other areas. not constant and varies with time and space. Therefore, the size distribution cannot be easily modeled through a fi xed model. However, the extinction formula can be employed to simplify the parameterization work. In the procedure, the term l  a in Eq. (6) is used as a parameter for describing the regional aerosol size distribution. The data set, collected by the sunphotometer from May to August in 1998, was used to calculate the AOD (Holben et al., 1998) at the SPOT HRV XS1 band. In addition, the atmospheric turbidity can further be obtained by regression with sunphotometer measurements of four wavelength fi lters (440, 670, 870 and 1020 nm) based on Eq. (6). The relationship between these two values forms a cone-shape scatter, in which the variation of the atmospheric turbidity increases as the AOD value increases (see also Fig. 4(a)). But the linear relationship is still very high ( R 2 is 0.93). A linear regression was applied to the data set, which derived a mean a value of 1.33. This value is almost consistent with the value suggested ( = 1.3) by A ̊ ngstro ̈ m, implying that the aerosol condition is normal during this period. From Fig. 4(a), we can see that the size distribution may be a combi-nation of two groups, and indeed it can be separated at a = 0.9 (see also Fig. 4(b) and (c)). At this separation, both groups show a even higher correlation ( R 2  0.98). In Fig. 4(b), 86% of the total aerosol particles are removed from Fig. 4(a) in constructing the graph, which is composed mainly of smaller sized particles. The mean value of a for these dominating aerosols is about 1.44, which can be used to represent the aerosol size parameter over the local area and to compute the atmospheric tur-bidity. In Fig. 4(c), the graph indicates larger particles, which have a percentage of 14% and the mean value of a is 0.36. Because the experimental period of this study was from May to August, dust storm events from Mongolia were rare generally. This implies that there were very few large aerosol particles and the atmosphere contained mostly smog and hydrometeor particles. Therefore, more long-term observations must be made along with the inclusion of dust storm events to further examine the algorithm in assessing the atmospheric turbidity and aerosol size distribution property. According to the results, the AOD values have a nice linear relationship with the atmospheric turbidity. There-fore, the former can be derived from the latter by simpli-fying the A ̊ ngstro ̈ m turbidity formula to the following: b  A t a l , (8) where A is a measure of the mean particle size of the regional aerosol constituents and t a l is the AOD at wavelength l . With this relationship, the satellite images can be easily converted to the AOD and atmospheric turbidity maps for air quality monitoring when the mean particle size of the aerosols is known. 4. Conclusions In this study, the results in retrieving AOD showed that the directional extent in the structure function algor-ithm can work to reduce the errors caused by changes in observation geometry, landcover and terrain.

The result also showed that the SPOT HRV XS1 channel enjoys a nice linear relationship with the atmospheric turbidity. Based upon our observation data gathered in the four months, the retrievals were satisfactory. However, more long-term data should be collected to elucidate the seasonal characteristics of aerosol particles and establish an aero-sol database for more applications. Additionally, the regional characteristics also should be taken into account and investigated. We are quite optimistic that air quality and global atmospheric radiation shall be monitored more accurately and conveniently by satellite obser-vations in the future.
