1. Introduction

[ 2 ] Operational remote sensing of the Earth ’ aerosol and surface reflectance is based on the look ‐ up tables (LUT). The LUTs store precomputed radiative transfer (RT) func-

tions that allow fast and accurate modeling of the top ‐ of ‐ the ‐ atmosphere (TOA) radiance for sensor ’ s wavelengths as a function of view geometry and atmosphere ‐ surface para-meters. A Lambertian surface assumption, used in devel-oped MODIS aerosol retrieval [ Levy et al. , 2007; Hsu et al. , 2005 and atmospheric correction [ Vermote and Kotchenova , 2008] algorithms, simplifies the mathematics and keeps the LUT size low. At the same time, accurate accounting for variations of the MODIS view geometry requires explicit incorporation of the surface bidirectional reflectance in the LUT algorithm and in the aerosol ‐ surface retrievals. Such an approach was developed by Martonchik et al. [1998] for MISR and later by Pinty et al. [2000] for Meteosat. Here

section 2 presents an accurate RT solution for the TOA radiance over an anisotropic surface, which is used in the Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm for MODIS.

[ 3 ] In order to preserve a realistic variability in the LUT while keeping its size within reasonable limits, several basic principles were suggested and implemented in the current operational algorithms, in particular from the Earth Observ-ing System [ King and Greenstone , 1999] MISR and MODIS instruments. In this work, we take advantage of an extensive groundwork done by the two teams, and present a synthetic LUT ‐ based radiance ‐ restore ( RR ) algorithm with an impor-tant addition for the water vapor correction. It uses the fol-lowing several basic principles:

[ 4 ] 1. Different aerosol types, such as dust, biomass burning, sea salt etc., are modeled as a combination of fine and coarse fractions. The RT functions of aerosol mixture are calculated from the fractional LUTs using a linear mixture (LM) [ Wang and Gordon , 1994] and a modified linear mixture (LMM) [ Abdou et al. , 1997] algorithms.

[ 5 ] 2. To reduce the LUT size, the single ‐ scattering path radiance and the direct surface ‐ reflected radiance, which are responsible for most of angular variability of the TOA radiance, are singled out and calculated analytically for a given set of parameters. The other RT functions depend rather smoothly on angles because of atmospheric multiple scattering of light, and can be calculated and stored in the LUT using a relatively sparse angular grid.

[ 6 ] 3. The dense grid of angles was used in this paper ( D m = 0.02, D ’ = 3°), where m is cosine of zenith angle and ’ is azimuth. This accelerates the radiance ‐ restore speed by the use of the nearest ‐ neighbor angles instead of a costly 3D interpolation [ Diner et al. , 2001].

[ 7 ] 4. The surface pressure correction is implemented via linear interpolation between two LUTs computed for a standard and a reduced pressure.

[ 8 ] 5. The LUTs are calculated for a reference atmo-spheric column water vapor (e.g., W 0 = 0.5 cm). The RR algorithm calculates the single ‐ scattering path radiance analytically for a specific value W , and corrects the surface ‐ reflected radiance using the two ‐ way direct transmission. A new fast analytical method is proposed for the water vapor correction of the multiple ‐ scattering path radiance.

[ 9 ] Below, section 2 describes an accurate semianalytical solution for the TOA reflectance with anisotropic surface. The new water vapor correction algorithm is described in section 3. The surface pressure/height correction method is presented in section 4 followed by a brief summary of LM and MLM methods (section 5). Section 6 gives a synopsis of the radiance ‐ restore algorithm. The paper is concluded with a brief summary.

2. Expression for Top ‐ of ‐ Atmosphere Reflectance

[ 10 ] Algorithm MAIAC resulted from an effort to develop an operational algorithm for MODIS with explicit minimi-zation where parameters of the surface bidirectional reflec-tance factor (BRF) model can be calculated analytically from measurements. A similar approach developed by Martonchik et al. [1998] for MISR features a relatively

small size of the look ‐ up table (LUT) and a high efficacy, which is critically important for operational algorithm. We will be using a high ‐ accuracy semianalytical formula for the top ‐ of ‐ atmosphere (TOA) radiance derived with the Green ’ s function method [ Lyapustin and Knyazikhin , 2001; Lyapustin and Wang , 2005]. [ 11 ] The following notation is used below:

T atmospheric optical thickness (OT); t g , t w absorption OT of 5 well ‐ mixed gases (CO 2 ,CH 4 ,

NO 2 , CO, N 2 O) and of water vapor; s 0 , s incidence and view directions defined by pairs of zenith and azimuthal angles (  , ’ ); for brevity, ’ will also stand for the difference ’ − ’ 0 ; m 0 , m cosines of the solar zenith angle (SZA) and view zenith angle (VZA) ( m = cos  ); the z axis is pointed downward, so m 0 > 0 for the solar beam and m <0 for the reflected beam. p S l extraterrestrial solar spectral irradiance; r , q surface bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and

surface albedo, respectively; c 0 spherical albedo of the atmosphere.

[ 12 ] The TOA radiance L ( s 0 , s ) is expressed as a sum of the atmospheric path radiance ( D ), and surface ‐ reflected radiance ( L s ), directly and diffusely transmitted through the atmosphere,

Here a is a multiple reflection factor, a =(1 − q ( m 0 ) c 0 ) − 1 , where q is surface albedo. The diffusely transmitted surface ‐ reflected radiance at the TOA is calculated from L s with the help of 1D diffuse Green ’ s function of the atmosphere,

[ 14 ] These formulas give an explicit expression for the TOA radiance as a function of surface BRF. The accuracy of the above formulas is high, usually within a few tenths of a percent [ Lyapustin and Knyazikhin , 2001]. Below we will use the TOA reflectance, which is defined as

2.1. Expression for the TOA Reflectance Using the RTLS BRF Model

[ 15 ] Based on the described semianalytical solution, TOA reflectance can be expressed as an explicit function of parameters of the BRF model. We are using a semiem-pirical Ross – Thick Li – Sparse (RTLS) BRF model [ Lucht et al. , 2000]. This is a linear model, represented as a sum of Lambertian, geometric ‐ optical, and volume scat-tering components,

 0 ;;’ ðÞ¼ k L þ k G f G  0 ;;’ ðÞþ k V f V  0 ;;’ ðÞ : ð 7 Þ

It uses predefined geometric functions (kernels) f G , f V to describe different angular shapes. The kernels are indepen-dent of the land conditions. The BRF of a pixel is charac-terized by a combination of three kernel weights, ~ K ={ k L , k G , k V } T . The RTLS model is used in the operational MODIS BRF/albedo algorithm [ Schaaf et al. , 2002].

[ 16 ] The substitution of equation (7) into equations (1) – (5) and normalization to the reflectance units gives the following expressions for the surface ‐ reflected signal (the last two terms of equation (1)):

[ 17 ] Different functions of these equations represent dif-ferent integrals of the incident path radiance ( D s ) and atmospheric Green ’ s function ( G ) with the BRF kernels.

With these notations, the TOA reflectance becomes

This equation, representing TOA reflectance as an explicit function of the BRF model parameters, provides the means for an efficient atmospheric correction.

[ 18 ] Let us derive a modified form of this equation which is used in the aerosol retrievals. The last nonlinear term of formula (25), which describes multiple reflections of the direct ‐ beam sunlight between the surface and the atmo-sphere, is small ( R nl / qc 0 ), and can be neglected for sim-plicity of further consideration. The functions F k are still weakly nonlinear via parameter a , which describes multiple reflections of the diffuse incident sunlight. By setting a =1, we omit this nonlinearity and equation (25) becomes a linear function of the BRF parameters.

[ 19 ] MAIAC aerosol retrievals, described in the compan-ion paper, involve an assumption of spectral similarity of the BRF shape between the visible wavelengths ( l ) and MODIS shortwave infrared band B7 (2.1 m m),

  ij  0 ; ; ’ ðÞ¼ b  ij  B 7 ij  0 ; ; ’ ðÞ : ð 26 Þ

With this assumption, formula (25) can be rewritten for the pixel ( i , j ) and observation day k as

R k ij  ðÞffi R D ; k  þ b ij  ðÞ Y ij ; k  ; ð 27 Þ

where b ij ( l ) is spectral regression coefficient for a given spectral band, and function

ð 28 Þ

can be calculated from the look ‐ up table (LUT) for a given geometry, AOT and wavelength, once the BRF parameters in band B7 for the pixel ( i , j ) are known.

[ 20 ] Finally, it should be mentioned that the simplified derivation of equations (27) and (28) in linear approxima-tion was given solely for an illustrative purpose, and MAIAC processing uses accurate equations including non-linear effects. 2.2. MAIAC Look ‐ Up Tables

[ 21 ] The LUT stores functions f k 1 , f k 2 , f k 3 , which depend on geometry of observations, and functions D k 1 , D k 3 , G av , G k 1 , G k 11 , H k 1 , E 0 d , E 0 , R D , which depend on geometry, selected aerosol model and AOT. Index k refers to either volumetric ( V ) or geometric ‐ optical ( G ) BRF kernel function. Follow-ing MISR algorithm [ Diner et al. , 2001, 1999], we store only a multiple ‐ scattering path reflectance ( R Dms ) in the LUT, and single ‐ scattering part is calculated exactly for a given geometry, pressure and water vapor. The LUT is computed for a dense grid of VZA, SZA, and azimuthal angles ( D m 0 = D m = 0.02 for the range 0.4 – 1 (0° – 66.42°), and D ’ = 3°). Similarly to MISR processing, the algorithm uses the nearest neighbor angle for speed consideration because it avoids 3D interpolation in angles. In addition, the LUT stores spherical albedo of atmosphere c 0 which de-pends on aerosol model and AOT. The LUT is calculated for 12 AOT values, {0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, 4.0}. A linear interpolation is used to derive LUT functions for the required AOT. The grid density was selected empirically from considerations of accuracy and of minimal required memory. The current size of the LUT for Rayleigh atmosphere, and for one fine and one coarse aerosol fraction for 7 MODIS land bands is 78 MB.

[ 22 ] The radiative transfer calculations were done with LUT ‐ generation software based on the code SHARM [ Lyapustin , 2005] and the Interpolation and Profile Cor-rection (IPC) method [ Lyapustin , 2003]. The IPC method is designed for fast line ‐ by ‐ line calculations in the spectral interval of interest with flexible spectral resolution of 0.01 – 1cm − 1 and an accuracy of several tenths of a percent. The line ‐ by ‐ line calculations are then integrated directly with solar irradiance (R. L. Kurucz, The solar irradiance by computation, 1997, http://cfaku5.cfa.harvard.edu/papers/ irradiance/) and sensor ’ s relative spectral response (RSR) function of MODIS (X. Xiong, personal communication, 2008). The computations included absorption of 6 major atmospheric gases (H 2 O, CO 2 ,CH 4 ,NO 2 , CO, N 2 O) cal-culated for the HITRAN ‐ 2000 [ Rothman et al. , 2003] data-base using a Voigt vertical profile, and the Atmospheric Environmental Research (AER) continuum absorption model [ Clough et al. , 2005]. Because ozone absorption is corrected separately, it was not included in LUT calculations. The LUT is generated for a fixed column water vapor, W 0 = 0.5 cm. The correction of LUT functions for the water vapor variations is done analytically, as described in section 3. In the visible part of spectrum, the path radiance is computed with the vector radiative transfer code [ Budak and Korkin , 2008]. The aerosol optical properties are computed using spherical and spheroidal kernel models developed by Dubovik et al. [2006].

[ 23 ] The LUT is calculated as follows: functions R Dms ( m 0 , m , ’ ), E 0 ( m 0 ), E 0 d ( m 0 ), c 0 , l C (effective band center wavelength), and t l R , t l g (in ‐ band effective Rayleigh and gaseous absorption optical thicknesses) are calculated first with RSR of sensor. For example, the atmospheric path reflectance is calculated using the following expression:

R D  0 ;;’ ðÞ¼

D  S  R D   0 ;;’ ðÞ h  d   Z

D 

S  h  d : ð 29 Þ

[ 24 ] The effective band center wavelength is defined as a wavelength for which monochromatic and narrow ‐ band direct vertical transmittances of the aerosol ‐ free atmosphere are equal,

D  S  exp f  R  ðÞg h  d   Z

S  h  d : ð 30 Þ

On the next step, functions of kernels ( D k 1 ( m 0 , m , ’ ), G av ( m ), G k 1 ( m 0 , m , ’ ), G k 11 ( m ), H k 1 ( m 0 , m , ’ ), k = v , go ) are calculated with monochromatic RT at the band center wavelengths l C , and with optical thickness of the in ‐ band gaseous absorption t l g computed with equation (30). Because functions of ker-nels are calculated for a large number of quadrature and view geometry angles, this approach is selected for its speed. The monochromatic solution provides an accuracy of better than 0.2% because gaseous absorption in the MODIS bands B1 – B16 is low. The values of l C , t l R , t l g and column absorption optical thickness of water vapor t l w calculated for MODIS TERRA land bands (B1 – B7) are shown in Table 1.

[ 25 ] Following MODIS [ Levy et al. , 2007] and MISR [ Diner et al. , 2001] aerosol algorithms, the LUT is calculated for the fine and coarse aerosol fractions separately. Because of this, aerosols can be retrieved with various models con-structed by mixing the fine and coarse aerosol modes in different proportions, while keeping the LUT size relatively small. Calculations for the aerosol mixtures are performed with linear mixing method (LMM) [ Wang and Gordon , 1994] for all functions except path radiance. For high accuracy of calculations, we are using LMM for the single ‐ scattering path radiance, which is exact in this case, and a modified LMM [ Abdou et al. , 1997] for the multiple ‐ scat-tering part. The modified method is remarkable for its high accuracy in conditions of high AOT or larger aerosol absorption, when the standard LMM breaks. The pressure corrections and water vapor corrections of the LUT functions are done with the algorithm described below.

3. Water Vapor Correction of the Multiple ‐ Scattering Path Radiance

[ 26 ] Let D m stand for the multiple ‐ scattering path radiance at a reference column water vapor W 0 . Given D m ( W 0 ) from the look ‐ up table, how can this function be evaluated for an

arbitrary atmospheric water vapor? The approach described below uses a perturbation technique and was originally developed for the narrow ‐ band and broadband radiative transfer [ Lyapustin , 2003]. Let us assume that the vertical profile of water vapor does not change with variations of its column amount. Given the coefficients of absorption k ( z ), scattering s (z), extinction a ( z )= s ( z )+ k ( z ), and the scat-tering function p ( g ), where g is angle of scattering, D m is described by the following radiative transfer equation:

Here D s is a single ‐ scattering path radiance, m = cos  is cosine of the view zenith angle (VZA), and s is a solid angle. A change in the water vapor amount W = W 0 + d W and related change of extinction a d ( z )= a ( z )+ da ( z ) cause perturbation of the multiple ‐ scattering radiance D m + d D m ,

To evaluate the scattering integral, we assume that the angular dependence of variation d D m + d D s is relatively small, and this term can be taken outside of the integral sign. Then, equation (33) turns into an ordinary differential equation

[ 28 ] To perform integration, we divide atmosphere into N homogeneous layers, and use a linear approximation of known functions d D s and D m within each layer, d D s ( t )= d D i s + g i ( t − t i d ), D m ( t )= D i m + e i ( t − t i d ). Along with the boundary conditions at the top (TOA) and bottom (BOA) of the atmosphere, this yields the following solution for the variation:

To assess the accuracy of this expression, we have per-formed extensive numerical simulations of path radiance in the MODIS TERRA bands for different aerosol types and atmospheric moisture.

[ 30 ] An example of accuracy analysis for a typical con-tinental aerosol model and a dust model from AERONET classification [ Dubovik et al. , 2002] is shown in Figure 1. The continental aerosol is represented by the urban low ‐ absorption model for the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and the dust is described by the model for Solar Village, Saudi Arabia. The column water vapor in calcula-tions was varied from 0.3 cm to 6 cm. The typical range of water vapor values for the United States midlatitudes is 0.3 – 1.5 cm for the winter to 1.5 – 4 cm in the summer.

[ 31 ] The dotted lines show the relative reduction of path radiance by the water vapor absorption with respect to the baseline values calculated at W 0 = 0.5 cm (( D ( W )/ D ( W 0 ) − 1) × 100%). In the MODIS TERRA red (B1) and near ‐ IR (B2) bands, the water vapor absorption may reduce the path radi-ance by 1 – 3%. This effect is negligible in the green (B4) and blue (B3) bands, whereas in the 2.1 m m region (B7), it may be as high as 2 – 12%.

[ 32 ] The solid lines show the accuracy of path radiance with the multiple ‐ scattering correction. The results are shown for a typical geometry of SZA = VZA = 45°, and a relative azimuth 0°. Figure 1 shows that except B7, the accuracy of corrected path radiance is generally better than 0.5 – 1%. Because an isotropic approximation was used in assessing the scattering integral, the error reduction is angle ‐ dependent, ranging between a factor of ≈ 2 to a factor of 10.

4. Surface Pressure/Height Correction

[ 33 ] The main LUT is calculated for the standard atmo-spheric pressure P 0 = 1013.25 mB and W 0 = 0.5 cm. The change in the surface elevation calls for pressure correction of the LUT functions. For purely Rayleigh and nonabsorb-ing atmosphere, the pressure correction at wavelength l C

thickness ( t B 1 a = 0.18, t B 7 a = 0.03), and (b) dust (Solar Vil-lage model, Saudi Arabia), medium optical thickness ( t B 1 a = 0.53, t B 7 a = 0.53). could be achieved by sliding the wavelength from the band center in order to agree with the pressure ‐ reduced Rayleigh optical depth,

In this case, the pressure correction can be done via spectral interpolation between the given band and its longer ‐ wave neighbor. Because Rayleigh optical depth rapidly decreases with wavelength, t R ( l ) ≈ a l − 4.09 , such a correction requires only a small wavelength shift, e.g., ≈ 2.5% for P ( z ) = 900 mB, or ≈ 5.3% for 800 mB. Assuming that the associated spectral changes of the aerosol phase function or aerosol absorption are small, this approach can be applied for the atmospheres with aerosol. This idea of pressure correction via wavelength shift was first suggested by Fraser et al. [1989], and it is implemented in the MODIS aerosol algorithm [ Levy et al. , 2007].

[ 34 ] Through numerical analysis, we found that spectral change of the aerosol phase function between the neighbor channels, e.g., blue and green, can be substantial and can cause errors of path radiance of 10 – 30% at pressure levels 900 – 800 mB. For this reason, a straightforward linear interpolation approach was selected by using a second LUT_0.7 computed at a reduced pressure P = 700 mB. This LUT is computed for the visible MODIS channels B1 – B4 and B8. At longer wavelengths (B5 – B7), the Rayleigh scattering is low and pressure/height correction is no longer necessary. The RR algorithm computes the single ‐ scattering path radiance analytically for a given surface pressure and water vapor, while the described pressure correction is used for the other required RT functions. Overall, RR algorithm uses two linear interpolations, in pressure and aerosol optical thickness.

5. Linear Mixture and Modified Linear Mixture Methods

[ 35 ] The path radiance is split into the single ‐ and multiple ‐ scattering components. For the mixture of the fine ( f ) and coarse ( c ) aerosol fractions, the function D s is calculated with the LM method, which is exact in the single scattering,

D s ¼ X w i D s i : ð 39 Þ

Here w i = t i a / t a is a fractional contribution from the total aerosol optical depth

 a  ðÞ¼  a f  ðÞþ  a c  ðÞ¼ C Vf h f  ðÞþ C Vc h c  ðÞ

¼ C Vf h f  ðÞþ  h c  ðÞ  ; ð 40 Þ

h = C Vc / C Vf is spectrally independent ratio of volumetric concentrations of coarse and fine fractions, and h i ( l )= t i a ( l )/ C Vi is a fractional optical thickness per unitary concentration. For example, h ≈ 0.5 for the AERONET [ Holben et al. , 1998] aerosol model for the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) at moderate AOT. Given the size distribution and refractive index, when the functions h f ( l ), h c ( l ) are fixed, the spectral slope of the total AOT (Angstrom parameter) is defined by the ratio h .

[ 36 ] The LUT stores functions h f ( l ), h c ( l ), which char-acterize given aerosol fractions, and do not depend on the total AOT t a ( l ). Then, the combination of two parameters
